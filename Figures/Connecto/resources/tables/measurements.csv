Coverage density,density,,custom_hot_gray,0,1,0,"How many electrode contacts are available for a given cortical area. The coverage density concerns cortical areas, not connections. For connections it is shown as the average coverage density between two connections."
Eucl. distance (MNI),d,,cool,0,150,0,"How far are two electrode contacts from each other, measured in the three-dimensional space of the MNI template brain."
Eucl. distance (inflated),d_inf,,cool,0,200,0,"How far are two electrode contacts from each other, measured in the three-dimensional space of the inflated brain. This will give slightly different results from Euclidean distance in MNI space as the gyri tend to move away from each other as the sulci are inflated."
Latency,peak_latency,Sig,custom_orange_to_gray,0,0.15,1,"How long does it take for a cortical signal to go from the stimulated to the recording electrode. Latencies are measured in milli-seconds and are directional."
Magnitude,LL,Sig,custom_hot_gray,0,5,1,"How strong is the cortical response. Magnitudes are measured as the line-length of the recorded cortical response and are directional."
Signaling probability,Sig,,custom_Blues_gray,0,1,1,"How often does a cortical response occur, when a given electrode is stimulated. Probabilities are directional."
Directionality index,DI,,custom_PRGn_gray,-1,1,0,"What is the ration between the response probability in one and the inverse direction. The directionality index tends to zero for bidirectional, to +1 for outgoing and to -1 for incoming cortical signaling."
Main direction,DI,Sig,custom_PRGn_gray,-1,1,0,"Which is the direction most often observed for signal transmission for a given pair of electrodes. The main direction highlights visually, which is the dominant signaling direction."
NREM sleep effect,NREM_effectsize,Sig,custom_seismic_gray,-1,1,1,"How does NREM sleep modulate the connection strength. The sleep modulation index tends to zero for no change, to +1 for an increase and to -1 for a decrease in cortical signaling compared to wakefulness."
REM sleep effect,REM_effectsize,Sig,custom_seismic_gray,-1,1,1,"How does REM sleep modulate the connection strength. The sleep modulation index tends to zero for no change, to +1 for an increase and to -1 for a decrease in cortical signaling compared to wakefulness."
